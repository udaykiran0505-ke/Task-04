The objective is to build a classifier that can distinguish between benign and malignant tumors using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values and scaling features using StandardScaler from scikit-learn. A logistic regression model was then trained and evaluated using several performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. The sigmoid function, which underlies logistic regression, was also visualized to demonstrate how the model converts linear combinations of features into probabilities. The results showed that the model performs well in classifying tumors with high accuracy and a strong ROC-AUC score, indicating good discriminative ability.
